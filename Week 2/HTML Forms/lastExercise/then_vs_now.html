<!-- File input/Submit 
Create a form used for submitting "Then VS Now" dieting/workout images and a description
The form should contain two file input fields
Both of the fields are file inputs
They are used by the user for uploading the pictures of them and showing what they looked like before they started working out, and how they look now
The page has to have an area where the user can put a picture description
At the end of the form, there should be a submit button with text "Send" that is used to submit the form
The form is submitted on page "handle-upload.html" and the user is redirected to it upon pressing the button
This page should contain just a "Form submitted successfully"! message -->
